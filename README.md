The ! symbol at the beginning of the line is used to negate the exit status of the command -v aspell command. This means that the if statement will be true (i.e., aspell is not installed) only if the command -v aspell command returns a non-zero exit status, indicating that aspell is not found in the system's PATH.
The script first prompts the user to enter the folder path using the read command, which stores the user's input in the folder_path variable.
Then, it uses a for loop to iterate over every .txt file in the folder using the wildcard "$folder_path"/*.txt. For each file, it prints a message to the console indicating which file is being checked, and then runs the aspell -c command to spell check the file. The -c flag tells aspell to check the file and provide suggested corrections interactively in the console.
